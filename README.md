A fun and interactive Rock Paper Scissors web app built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
This project lets users play against the computer in a simple, clean, and responsive interface.

<h2>How It Works</h2>

The user chooses Rock, Paper, or Scissors by clicking the button.

The computer randomly selects one of the three options.

The program compares both choices based on game rules:

Rock beats Scissors

Paper beats Rock

Scissors beats Paper

The result (Win / Lose / Draw) is displayed instantly.

Scores update automatically after each round.
